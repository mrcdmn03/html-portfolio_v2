    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I graduated from Hacettepe University with a degree in
        Mining & Mineral Engineering and from Anadolu
        University with a degree in Business Administration &
        Management. Additionally, I earned a Master of
        Science (M.S.) in Occupational Health and Safety from
        Ömer Halis University (2019 - 2020). I served as a
        Military Officer in the Turkish Armed Forces for two
        years and later worked as a Mine Planning Engineer at
        Centerra Gold Mining Company. My core
        competencies include mine planning (both long-term
        and short-term plans, pit optimization, and open-pit
        mine design) and advanced reporting (creating
        sophisticated dashboards using Excel and Power BI).
        My technical proficiency encompasses a range of
        industry-relevant applications such as Minesight,
        Geovia Surpac, Micromine, Ventsim, AutoCAD,
        NetCAD, the Microsoft Office Suite (Excel, Word,
        PowerPoint, Power BI), Civil 3D, and SQL.</p>
